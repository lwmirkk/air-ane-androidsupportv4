Android Services v4 ANE for Adobe AIR
=====================================

This ANE has no API, it simply adds the Android Services v4 library to Android apps created using Adobe AIR 20+ to prevent build issues caused by multiple AIR native extensions containing the same third party libraries.

To use the ANE, simply add it to your project in the usual way; no ActionScript is required.
